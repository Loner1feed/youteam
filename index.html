                            JavaScript has been identified as one of the most popular programming languages in the world of web and software development.

                            JavaScript has been identified as one of the most popular programming languages in the world of web and software development. It was initially created for web pages to appear more animated and feel more lively. The programs written in this language are called scripts and can be directly written in the HTML or HTML5 version of the webpage so that it automatically runs when the page loads. They are usually executed as plain text and do not require an impressive compilation. While many people seem to be confused between JavaScript and Java, this is the main point of difference here. In the scope of web development, JavaScript has been standardized and is supported inherently by most web browsers. The need for a JavaScript developer has been felt by most app development companies as it was found useful in various aspects, such as:
